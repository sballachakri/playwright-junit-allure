package org.example.examples.interfaces;

//interface - is pure abstract class
//interface is any service requirement specification
//interface can contain default,static methods
//interface contains method declaration only not implementation.
//the class that implements are responsible for implementation.
//every method in interface are public or abstract;
//whenever we implement interface, all the methods in interface should be implemented - override
//if we want to implement a single method/not all then declare class abstract in



// example: for java application wants to communicate with Oracle db, we require some interface.i.e Driver - JDBC
